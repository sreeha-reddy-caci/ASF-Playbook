## Jira and Confluence

## Issue Types
* To make issue categorization more efficient and easy to understand by everyone on your team, the ASF Jira template has a streamlined list of issue type options. These options have been refined to only include issue types that are relevant to Agile methodology and the needs of the ASF.  

* Standard issue types are the options that your team will likely use the most often. The standard issue types include: 

## Fields and Screens
* For each issue type in the ASF Jira template, there is a specific list of fields that are related to each issue type. These fields help you and your team to put in only the most useful information into an issue type, ensuring that your planning isn't cluttered while still having all the necessary information.  

## Roles and Permissions

* There are specific roles that are designed to be in charge of certain tasks. Higher level roles have more freedom and responsibilities within the Jira template. The different types of roles depend on not only what you do in your team, but within the actual Jira template itself. The different types of roles, in order, are: 

1. Atlassian Admin 
    * The Atlassian Admin is the highest level on the Jira template, and has the ability to configure and manage the Jira instance. They can change settings, manage users, and usually have no restrictions on what they are allowed to do. A role like this is given out to a few people who are then set to oversee the system.  
    
    * No restrictions 

2. Users 
    * The Atlassian Admin is the highest level on the Jira template, and has the ability to configure and manage the Jira instance. They can change settings, manage users, and usually have no restrictions on what they are allowed to do. A role like this is given out to a few people who are then set to oversee the system.  

    * No restrictions 

3. Team Lead 
    * This is a label that covers a number of different jobs. Business Analyst, Scrum Master, Product Owner, and Product Architect, who all need to have the capabilities of making stories or changing the status of an epic. Even when this label covers different jobs, they all need to have the same level of control over the project. This all-encompassing label makes it easier to assign permissions for all of these jobs. 

    * No restrictions 

4. Team Member 
    * These are the developers working on a project, completing work and creating artifacts. They are able to effect and change lower level work, like subtasks and logging work. They contribute to the completion of a project, so they cannot make higher level changes like adding epics. 

    * Cannot effect epics or stories 
    
5. View-Only User 
    * Users that are only allowed to look at and comment on projects. They cannot change anything about the project and are there to peer review/look over other's work.  
    * View Only Permissions
